This project allows the user to get informations from the Binance API [https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/], a global cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading more than 100 cryptocurrencies. Its API provides information about the trades of cryptocurrencies on its platform.
Then, the user can store them in a mongoDB database and make some queries to filter and print these documents.
